# NBA-Player-Prediction-Model

A Python-based machine learning application that predicts whether an NBA player will score above or below a target point total in their next game. The prediction is based on historical performance data from the last three seasons, recent games, and head-to-head matchups.

## Features

- Player performance analysis using NBA API data
- Historical data analysis from the last 3 seasons
- Recent form analysis (last 5 games)
- Head-to-head matchup analysis (last 3 games against specific opponent)
- Machine learning prediction using Logistic Regression with cross-validation
- Confidence scoring for predictions
- Home/Away game consideration

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install nba_api scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Follow the prompts to enter:
   - Player name (full name, e.g., "LeBron James")
   - Target points (e.g., "25")
   - Opponent team abbreviation (3 letters, e.g., "GSW")
   - Game location ("home" or "away")

## Example Output

```bash
(venv) âžœ  NBA Player Prediction Model git:(main) python3 main.py
Enter player name: Lebron James
Enter target points: 25
Enter opponent team (3-letter abbreviation): PHX
Is it a home game or away? (home/away): away

[{'id': 2544, 'full_name': 'LeBron James', 'first_name': 'LeBron', 'last_name': 'James', 'is_active': True}]

Average points from the last 5 games: 23.00

Last 5 Games:
      GAME_DATE      MATCHUP  PTS  REB  AST  STL  BLK
0  OCT 26, 2024  LAL vs. SAC   32   14   10    0    1
1  OCT 25, 2024  LAL vs. PHX   21    4    8    0    0
2  OCT 22, 2024  LAL vs. MIN   16    5    4    0    2

Last 3 Matchups with the Opponent:
     GAME_DATE      MATCHUP  PTS  REB  AST  STL  BLK
1   2024-10-25  LAL vs. PHX   21    4    8    0    0
5   2024-10-06  LAL vs. PHX   19    5    4    0    2
37  2024-02-25    LAL @ PHX   28    7   12    2    1

Average points from the last 3 matchups: 22.67

The model predicts Lebron James will score below 25 points.
Cross-Validated Model Accuracy: 99.47%
Model's Confidence in scoring above 25 points: 19.07%
```

### Understanding the Output

1. **Player Verification**: Shows the matched player data from NBA database
2. **Recent Performance**:
   - Average points from last 5 games
   - Detailed stats table of last 5 games including points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks
3. **Head-to-Head Analysis**:
   - Last 3 games against the specified opponent
   - Average points in these matchups
4. **Prediction**:
   - Clear prediction above/below target points
   - Model accuracy based on cross-validation
   - Confidence percentage for scoring above target

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Fetches player data using the NBA API
   - Retrieves game logs from the last 3 seasons
   - Collects recent game data and head-to-head matchups

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Combines historical and recent performance data
   - Incorporates game location (home/away) as a feature
   - Processes player statistics (points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks)

3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Uses Logistic Regression for binary classification
   - Implements 5-fold cross-validation for robust accuracy measurement
   - Provides probability scores for predictions

## Limitations

- Requires active internet connection for NBA API access
- Historical data limited to last 3 seasons
- Does not account for injuries or lineup changes
- Limited to basic box score statistics

## Potential Improvements

1. **Enhanced Data Collection**:
   - Include player injury history
   - Add team roster context
   - Consider opponent defensive ratings
   - Include player rest days between games

2. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Implement advanced statistics (PER, True Shooting %, etc.)
   - Add pace-adjusted statistics
   - Consider home/away performance splits
   - Include player matchup data

3. **Model Improvements**:
   - Test different ML algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Implement feature importance analysis
   - Add seasonal trends analysis
   - Consider player career trajectories

4. **User Experience**:
   - Add GUI interface
   - Include data visualization
   - Add batch prediction capability
   - Implement result export functionality

5. **Technical Enhancements**:
   - Add data caching to reduce API calls
   - Implement error handling for API failures
   - Add unit tests
   - Include data validation

## Error Handling

The program currently handles:
- Invalid player names
- Invalid team abbreviations
- Insufficient data for predictions
